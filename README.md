Analysis of Consumer Complaints


This project consists of modifying a spreadsheet on complaints from customers of financial companies, structuring it into three main tabs:

1. Consumer complaints: Table with complaints sorted by Complaint ID, with specific format, calculation of days between receipt and sending, and filter for complaints prior to 8 August 2016.
2. Geographical insights: Table with count and percentage of complaints by state, with conditional formatting for percentages.
3. Statistical insights: List of separate complaint grounds and calculation of fashion between complaint categories.

Each tab requires a precise format, defined borders and styles.
